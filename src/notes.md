## learn code with block code
## success, still running today
## Joke: boss didn't think it was crazy
## Talk inspired by event in other room
# Next: Img kids coding

## really enjoy interviewing people
## work at same company, clearly have something in common
# Next: What got you interested...

--

## people of all walks of life
